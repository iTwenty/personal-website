I like to mess around with 3D modelling in my spare time. Here are some things I have created using the amazing open source 3d modelling software called Blender.

### Donut & Coffee

The "hello world" of Blender, thanks to the comprehensive beginner's [tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEaoINr3zgEq0u2MzVgAaHEBt--xLB6U) by Blender Guru. This tutorial series is so famous, it even has it's own [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/BlenderDoughnuts/)!

Things learnt :
- Blender UI
- Keyboard shortcuts
- 3D 101 i.e vertices, edges, faces, topology, materials, textures etc.
- Animation basics

### Anvil

The next logical step after the beginner friendly donut tutorial is the intermediate anvil [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEaoINr3zgHJVJF3T3CFUAZ6z11jKg6a), again by Blender Guru. This didn't turn out as well I had hoped, but an anvil is not an exciting thing to model anyway...

Things learnt :
- Boolean modifier
- Refactoring mesh for better "flow"
- UV unwrapping
- HDRI lighting

### Chair

Yet another [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEaoINr3zgEL9UjPTLWQhLFAK7wVaRMR) from - you guessed it - Blender Guru! He is just that awesome :) Really like how this one turned out. The [real chair](https://www.fredericia.com/products/by-designer-b%C3%B8rge-mogensen/s%C3%B8borg-wood-base-1.aspx?PID=63&catid=6219) costs $700 by the way.

Things learnt :
- Working with reference images
- Some lighting basics

### iPhone XR

First non tutorial render, and it shows. Got stuck a lot while modelling this, so I was happy to just get it to an "almost done" state. Looks a bit cartoon-ish, although that wasn't my intention when I started.

### My Room

Really happy with this one! Was fun to model several small things shoddily then spend time on modelling one thing properly :P Was a good exercise to learn about cloth simulation while modelling the bed.
