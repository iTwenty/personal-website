## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jaydeep Joshi

I am a software engineer from Mumbai, India. I specialize in mobile development with particular interest in all things Apple. I occasionally like to break out of engineering mindset and look at the broader picture from a design and product perspective.

Outside the Apple walled garden, I like to tinker around with 3D modelling. [Blender](https://www.blender.org) is my tool of choice for this. You can find some of my creations [here]({{<ref "/blender/index.md">}} "Blender").

When not messing around on my laptop, I can usually be found cycling, running or hiking. I often daydream of moving to a remote cabin in the woods while my code is compiling. One day maybe...
