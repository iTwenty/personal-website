## Brahmaand
#### [GitHub](https://github.com/iTwenty/Brahmaand)
iOS app to browse [APODs](https://apod.nasa.gov/). There are already dozens of similar apps in the App Store, but none that I tried provided support for browsing APODs with left/right swipes. This one does. As a bonus, it also allows you to mark APODs as favorites, which are displayed separately from daily APODs.

## Hashtagger
#### [GitHub](https://github.com/iTwenty/Hashtagger)
Android app that *used to* search for any hashtag across Twitter, Facebook and Google Plus simultaneously. Worked great in it's glory days, but then Google decided to [kill Google Plus](https://gcemetery.co/google-plus/) and Facebook removed the search API the app relied on. Such is life.

## PasswordEditText
#### [GitHub](https://github.com/iTwenty/Android-PaswordEditText)
Small extension to EditText in Android that allows toggling the visibility of entered text in password input fields.
